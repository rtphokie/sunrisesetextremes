# Sun rise and set extremes

Uses Skyfield Python module to calculate Sun rise and set extrema at a given observation point for a given year.  

Note: these results are overly precise and the actual time the Sun may be first or last seen depends heavily on atmospheric conditions and may vary by a minute or more.
